	\section{Introduction}
	%TODO
	Short summary of \emph{My Zelda Cane} paper about what they wrote and noting that they did not explore general Accessibility Features current game companies are using/developing as well as state-of-the-art tools.
	In Addition to that I want to explore those tools and Accessibility Features deeper.
	As Third point I want to get a deeper look into how software companies handle features for blind people like \emph{The Last of Us: Part 2}.
	
	\section{State of the art}
	%TODO
	New tools for blind players and newest Accessibility Features software companies using/developing.
	
	Screen Reader
	Audio Cues and Descriptions
	Haptic Feedback
	Customizable Controls
	Text-to-Speech and Speech Recognition
	Accessible Menus and Interfaces
	Echolocation
