	abstract = {Mainstream games are typically designed around the visual experience, with behaviors and interactions highly dependent on vision. Despite this, blind people are playing mainstream games while dealing with and overcoming inaccessible content, often together with friends and audiences. In this work, we analyze over 70 hours of {YouTube} videos, where blind content-creators play visual-centric games. We point out the various strategies employed by players to overcome barriers that permeate mainstream games. We reflect on ways to enable and improve blind players’ experience with these games, shedding light on the positive and negative consequences of apparently benign design choices. Our observations underline how game elements are appropriated for accessibility, the incidental consequences of audio design, and the trade-offs between accessibility, agency, and engagement.},

	abstract = {Implementing accessibility features in digital games is an activity that has been growing over the years. Although these features do not exist in all digital games produced and distributed, some games stand out for their implemented features. In this context, this research involves the game “The Last of Us Part {II}” ({TLOU}2), which has more than 60 accessibility features and is considered, by some field experts, as the most accessible game ever produced. Considering the potential consequences that statements like this can represent for the games’ industry, this research analyzes the {TLOU}2 accessibility features with an analysis procedure based on resources and criteria from the community of practice and inclusion principles. From this evaluation, this study proposes an extension and improvement in the analysis procedure adopted, called {PANELI}, to encompass topics regarding inclusive digital games. Furthermore, we discuss the significance of {TLOU}2 accessibility features, the relevance of analysis procedure application, and its constant improvement and updates.},
