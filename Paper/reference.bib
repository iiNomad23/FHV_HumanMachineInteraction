	abstract = {Mainstream games are typically designed around the visual experience, with behaviors and interactions highly dependent on vision. Despite this, blind people are playing mainstream games while dealing with and overcoming inaccessible content, often together with friends and audiences. In this work, we analyze over 70 hours of {YouTube} videos, where blind content-creators play visual-centric games. We point out the various strategies employed by players to overcome barriers that permeate mainstream games. We reflect on ways to enable and improve blind players’ experience with these games, shedding light on the positive and negative consequences of apparently benign design choices. Our observations underline how game elements are appropriated for accessibility, the incidental consequences of audio design, and the trade-offs between accessibility, agency, and engagement.},

	abstract = {Implementing accessibility features in digital games is an activity that has been growing over the years. Although these features do not exist in all digital games produced and distributed, some games stand out for their implemented features. In this context, this research involves the game “The Last of Us Part {II}” ({TLOU}2), which has more than 60 accessibility features and is considered, by some field experts, as the most accessible game ever produced. Considering the potential consequences that statements like this can represent for the games’ industry, this research analyzes the {TLOU}2 accessibility features with an analysis procedure based on resources and criteria from the community of practice and inclusion principles. From this evaluation, this study proposes an extension and improvement in the analysis procedure adopted, called {PANELI}, to encompass topics regarding inclusive digital games. Furthermore, we discuss the significance of {TLOU}2 accessibility features, the relevance of analysis procedure application, and its constant improvement and updates.},

A percentage of the population of people with visual impairment are known to use echolocation -sound waves and their reflections- to better explore their surroundings. In this paper, we describe the development of an echolocation-enabled {VE} (Echo-House) and evaluate the feasibility of using echolocation as a novel technique to explore this environment. Results showed that echolocation gave participants an improved sense of space in the {VE}. However, the evaluation also identified a range of orientation and mobility issues and found that participants needed additional support to gain confidence in their use of echolocation in the {VE}. Our findings suggest that with proper support, echolocation has the potential to improve access to {VEs} for people who are blind or visually impaired by revealing features that would be otherwise inaccessible.},

	abstract = {Today, computer games are one of the major sources of entertainment. Computer games are usually far more demanding than typical interactive applications in terms of motor and sensory skills needed for interaction control, due to special-purpose input devices, complicated interaction techniques, and the primary emphasis on visual control and attention. This renders computer games inaccessible to a large percentage of people with disabilities. This article introduces the concept of universally accessible games, that is, games proactively designed to optimally fit and adapt to individual gamer characteristics and to be concurrently played among people with diverse abilities, without requiring particular adjustments or modifications. The concept is elaborated and tested through four case studies: a web-based chess game ({UA}-Chess), an action game (Access Invaders), a universally inaccessible game (Game Over!) used as an interactive educational tool, and an improved version of Access Invaders (Terrestrial Invaders). For all cases, key design and evaluation findings are discussed, reporting consolidated know-how and experience. Finally, the research challenge of creating multiplayer universally accessible games is further elaborated, proposing the novel concept of Parallel Game Universes as a potential solution.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and evaluation of "Game Over!", which is the world's first universally inaccessible game (i.e., a game that can be played by no one). The game is meant to be used as an educational tool for disseminating and teaching game accessibility guidelines. This is achieved by providing game developers a first-hand (frustrating) experience of how it feels interacting with a game that is not accessible, due to the fact that important design rules were not considered or applied during its design. Both the overall concept and the approach followed were evaluated and validated through: (a) an on-line survey; (b) "live" feedback from players and developers; and (c) public opinions and critique collected from numerous Web sites and blogs where "Game Over!" was presented and discussed. The evaluation outcomes strongly suggest that computer games and humor constitute a perfect match for reaching out, motivating and educating the game developers' community in the subject of game accessibility.},

	abstract = {Digital games have become increasingly popular for both entertainment and education purposes. However, making these games universal and accessible poses a challenge for interface designers and game developers, since they are usually unfamiliar with the peculiarities of gamers who are blind. More effort is necessary for contributing to a universal game design and, ultimately, helping to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities to take full advantages of digital games. In this research, we present a study concerning existent guidelines and recommendations for accessibility in digital games. As a result, we propose ten recommendations for the design of mobile audio games, targeting gamers who are blind. We also present an evaluation instrument assembled from the recommendations we propose. We used this instrument to assess ten audio games labeled as inclusive. Results indicate that only three from a total of ten games were considered “good”, which means they met the fundamental aspects of the guidelines.},
